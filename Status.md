# Introduction #

This project is currently a work in progress.

# Details #

In addition to the kml-super-overlay application, I am working on a more general Kml library for C# that uses Xml serialization of real classes rather than the Xml DOM approach or string parsing.

Top priority is currently to get the Kml library up to par. It may not be fleshed out completely, but all the structural issues and serialization hacks should to be worked out soon.
